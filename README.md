## WIP
This plugin is a work in progress, with a bunch of known bugs. 

## Hyprlift

Hyprlan plugin that creates an effect of a focused window being "lifted" (or as MaterialDesign refers to it -- elevated) over other windows. This is acheived by sizing down all other windows and (potentially) modifying shadow of a "focused" window.
